    "content": "Every student dreams of going abroad. But the biggest question is: Which country should I choose? Don’t just follow trends or friends. Choose based on your goals, budget, and future plans.\n\n🌍 Here's a simple breakdown:\n\nUSA – Best for research and top universities, but expensive with a strict visa process.\n\nCanada – Great for PR opportunities, jobs, and community support. However, visa rejections are rising and the climate can be harsh.\n\nUK – Offers 1-year PG programs with global recognition but comes with high living costs.\n\nAustralia – Known for work-life balance and ease of adaptation, but some regions can be costly.\n\nGermany – Offers free or low-cost education and is best for engineering, though it may require German proficiency and has limited part-time jobs.\n\nIreland – Ideal for tech and pharma jobs. It’s less popular but excellent for IT careers.\n\n💡 Tip: Ask yourself—Where can I work part-time safely? What are the job options after study? Will this help me get PR or a good career?\n\n📌 Your dream matters. Choose a country that supports it.",
